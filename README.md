# Qleany

**Architecture scaffolding generator for C++20/Qt6 or Rust 2024 applications — desktop, mobile, and CLI.**

> **No framework. No runtime. No Qleany dependencies in your code.**
> 
> The generated code is yours — plain C++ classes and Rust structs using standard libraries (Qt, redb). Modify it, extend it, delete Qleany afterward. You're not adopting a framework that will haunt your codebase for years or burn you when the maintainer moves on.

Building an app in Qt or Rust? Not sure how to structure it beyond "put code in files"?
Qleany generates a complete architecture: controllers, repositories, DTOs, undo/redo, reactive models, GUI skeletons — organized by feature, ready to extend.

Define your entities and relationships in a YAML manifest. Qleany generates several hundred repetitive files — saving you conservatively several days of tedious, error-prone work. Get a working structure that scales from a simple CLI tool to a full-featured application with desktop and mobile variants.

Qleany follows Package by Feature (Vertical Slice Architecture) principles. Define your entities and features once, generate consistent scaffolding across Rust and C++/Qt — whether you're targeting Linux desktop, Plasma Mobile, Ubuntu Touch, or all of them simultaneously.

## Why Qleany

I wrote [Skribisto](https://github.com/jacquetc/skribisto), a novel-writing application in Qt. Four times. In different languages. Each time, I hit the same wall: spaghetti code and structural dead-ends that made adding features painful and eventually impossible without rewriting half the codebase.

After the third rewrite, I studied architecture patterns seriously. Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin) clicked — the separation of concerns, the dependency rules, the testability. But implementing it by hand meant writing the same boilerplate over and over: repositories, DTOs, use cases, controllers. So I wrote templates. The templates grew into a generator. The generator needed a manifest file.

**Qleany v0** was Python/Jinja2 generating C++/Qt code following pure Clean Architecture. It worked, but the tradeoffs were hard to miss: a 17-entity project produced 1700+ files across 500 folders. Some of my early design choices were dubious in hindsight.

**Qleany v1** is a ground-up rewrite in Rust, aiming to fix those problems. Less sophisticated, more pragmatic. It adopts Package by Feature (Vertical Slice Architecture) instead of strict layer separation — same Clean Architecture principles, but organized by what the code does rather than what layer it belongs to. The same manifest now generates both C++/Qt and Rust code.

This is the tool I needed when I started Skribisto. If it saves someone else from their fourth rewrite, it's done its job.

## Key Features

- **Complete CRUD scaffolding** — Controllers, DTOs, use cases, repositories per entity
- **GUI skeleton generation** — Ready-to-compile frontend code for QtQuick, QtWidgets, Kirigami, or combinations thereof
- **Undo/redo system** (optional) — Command-based with grouping, scopes, and failure strategies; async execution with QCoro coroutines in C++/Qt, synchronous in Rust
- **Reactive QML models** — Auto-updating list models and single-entity wrappers (C++/Qt)
- **QML mocks** — JavaScript stubs for UI development without backend (C++/Qt)
- **Relationship management** — Junction tables with ordering, caching, cascade deletion
- **Event system** — Decoupled communication between features

## Is Qleany the Right Fit?

### When Qleany Makes Sense

**Data-centric applications** that will grow in complexity over time. Think document editors, project management tools, creative applications, or anything where users manipulate structured data and expect undo/redo to work reliably. This applies equally to desktop and mobile — a note-taking app on Plasma Mobile has the same architectural needs as one on desktop Linux.

**Complex CLI tools in Rust** — tools like `git` that manage structured data, have multiple subcommands, and need consistent internal architecture. Qleany itself is built this way: type `qleany -h` to see a CLI interface backed by the same architecture that powers its Slint GUI.

**Applications targeting multiple platforms** — if you're building for desktop Linux and want to support Plasma Mobile or Ubuntu Touch with the same codebase, Qleany's generated backend works identically across all of them. Write your business logic once, swap UI frontends as needed.

**Applications needing multiple Qt frontends** — if you need QtQuick, QtWidgets, KDE Widgets, or Kirigami (or any combination of them simultaneously), Qleany generates a ready-to-compile backend architecture that any of these frontends can consume. The generated controllers, repositories, and event system work identically regardless of which UI toolkit you choose.

**Solo developers or small teams** without established architectural patterns. Qt provides excellent widgets and signals, but no guidance on organizing a 30,000-line application. Qleany gives you that structure immediately, with patterns validated through real-world use in Skribisto.

**Projects that will grow incrementally** — the manifest-driven approach means you can define a new entity, regenerate the scaffolding, and immediately have a working controller, repository, DTOs, and use cases. The consistency this brings across your codebase is hard to achieve manually.

### When to Reconsider

For **simple utilities or single-purpose tools**, Qleany introduces more infrastructure than you need. If your application doesn't have complex entity relationships, doesn't need undo/redo, and won't grow significantly, a hand-written architecture may serve you better.

If you're working with a **team that already has established patterns**, introducing Qleany means everyone needs to learn its conventions. The generated code is readable and follows clear patterns, but it represents a specific way of doing things.

Qleany **targets native applications**. If you're building for the web, using Electron, or targeting Android/iOS with Flutter or React Native, this isn't the right tool. Similarly, if you need high-throughput server-side processing, the patterns here are optimized for user interaction, not request-per-second performance.

### The Practical Test

If your project matches the profile, start by **generating the scaffolding for a small subset of your entities** and spend time reading through the generated code. Understand how the controllers wire to use cases, how the event system propagates changes, how the undo commands work. This investment of a few hours will tell you whether the patterns feel natural to your way of thinking.

The "generate and disappear" philosophy means you're not locked in. If you decide halfway through that you'd prefer a different approach, the generated code is yours to modify or replace.

## Target Platforms

| Language | Standard | Database | Frontend Options |
|----------|----------|----------|------------------|
| C++ | C++20 / Qt6 | SQLite | QtQuick, QtWidgets, Kirigami, Ubuntu Touch Components |
| Rust | Rust 2024 | redb | CLI, Slint |

**Supported deployment targets for C++/Qt:**
- Desktop Linux (KDE Plasma, GNOME, etc.)
- Plasma Mobile
- Ubuntu Touch
- Windows, macOS (Qt's cross-platform support)

The generated backend is platform-agnostic. Your business logic, repositories, and controllers work identically whether you're building a desktop app, a mobile app, or both from the same codebase. Only the UI layer differs.

**Rust frontend examples (not generated, but working references):**
- **Slint UI**: [qleany/crates/slint_ui](https://github.com/jacquetc/qleany/tree/generator_in_rust/crates/slint_ui)
- **Tauri/React**: [qleany/crates/qleany-app](https://github.com/jacquetc/qleany/tree/885c3ac6fdf6f115aed2c5a30fd26b81e331b4dd/crates/qleany-app)

## Reference Implementation

[Skribisto](https://github.com/jacquetc/skribisto) (develop branch) is a novel-writing application built with Qleany-generated C++/Qt code. It demonstrates:

- Full entity hierarchy (Root → Work → Binder → BinderItem → Content)
- Complex relationships (ordered children, many-to-many tags)
- Feature orchestration (LoadWork, SaveWork with file format transformation)
- Reactive QML UI with auto-updating models
- Undo/redo across structural and content operations
- Crash recovery with ephemeral database

Skribisto serves as both proof-of-concept and template source for C++/Qt generation.

## Migration from v1

Qleany v1 (Python/Jinja2) generated pure Clean Architecture with strict layer separation. A 17-entity project produced 1700+ files across 500 folders.

v2 generates Package by Feature with pragmatic organization. The same project produces ~600 files across ~80 folders with better discoverability.

**Breaking changes:**
- Manifest format changed (schema version 2)
- Output structure reorganized by feature
- Reactive models are new (list models, singles)
